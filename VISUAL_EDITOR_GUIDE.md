## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Changes aren't showing"
- Make sure you clicked **"Save Changes"**
- Hard refresh the page: **Ctrl+F5** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
- Clear your browser cache

### "I can't find the Edit button"
- Look for the **floating pencil icon** at bottom-right
- OR check the **top-right toolbar**

### "Undo isn't working"
